This is code for the paper **"Individual-level parcellation of the human auditory cortex and comparison of their functional connectivity pattern"** (Submitted)<br />
**The paper link:** will be updated<br />
If you use this code, please cite the article.<br /><br />

This study is divided into following 3 steps:<br />
　　　**1)** Structural connectome-based PAC parcellation<br />
　　　**2)** Characterization of subregions in terms of functional connectome pattern<br />
　　　**3)** Identification of functional hierarchy of subregions via gradient analysis<br /><br />
